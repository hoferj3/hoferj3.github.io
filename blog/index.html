                    "The Raven" by Edgar Allen Poe is perhaps one of the most famous poems ever written. Published in
                    January 1845, "The Raven" is told from the perspective of a person pondering the loss of their love.
                    In the midst of such musings, the narrator is interrupted by a someone -or something- tapping at
                    their chamber door. After opening the door and being greeting with silence and darkness, they
                    whisper the name "Lenore." The only response received was an echo. Hearing the tapping once again,
                    the narrator opens the shutter and is met with the titular raven, who steps into the room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next part of the story is best told through the poem itself:
                <blockquote class="excerpt" cite="The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe"> Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad
                    fancy into smiling,<br>
                    By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>
                    “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,<br>
                    Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—<br>
                    Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”<br>
                    Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
                </blockquote>
                </p>
                <h3>Allusions and the Ending</h3>


                <!-- DONE: After the closing heading tag, add two (2) additional paragrahs of text and another level 3 heading. -->
                <p>From here, the story begins to delve into the narrator's sorrow with the loss of their love, Lenore.
                    They exclaim that the raven had been sent by God's angels to give them respite from the feelings of
                    pain. Next, the narrator pleads with the raven to tell them if there is <abbr
                        title="An metaphor for a cure-all balm, which could be used to heal one's grief." <sup> balm in
                        Gilead.</sup></abbr> Desperate for any answer, the narrator asks the raven if Lenore is now
                    "within the distant <abbr
                        title="An old way to refer to 'Eden' or 'Paradise.' This is likely the narrator referring to Heaven."
                        <sup>Aidenn.</sup></abbr> The narrator, enraged by the raven's non-satisfactory answers, demands
                    the bird take its leave with no trace it had been there. But no matter what, the raven gives the
                    same response: "Nevermore."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final stanza of the poem ends thusly:
                <blockquote class="excerpt" cite="The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe">
                    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>
                    On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>
                    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,<br>
                    And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>
                    And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>
                    Shall be lifted — nevermore!<br></blockquote>
                </p>

                <h3>The Concept of Grief</h3>
                <!-- DONE: After the closing heading tag, add three (3) paragraphs of text. -->
                <p>
                    Grief is often conceptualized through 5 distinct stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and
                    acceptance. Given this, I propose the theory that "the Raven" is a metaphor for these stages of
                    grief, with the titular raven itself representing "acceptance." The ending of the poem is a
                    representation of the narrator rejecting the final stage of grief, meant to begin the process of
                    healing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The story's tone is immediately set as the narrator ponders the loss of Lenore, their love. These
                    musings are broken by the sound of tapping at the chamber door, where the narrator softly calls to
                    Lenore. This is the indication of denial; the narrator is aware that Lenore is gone but still has
                    hope that she has returned to him. Here the narrator jumps around the stages of grief a little,
                    going to bargaining as he pleads with the raven to take away their pain and sorrow. Thirdly, the
                    narrator goes into the depression stage, trying to find comfort in the idea that Lenore was still
                    alive in Heaven. As a final act of rejection, the narrator snaps, angrily telling the raven to leave without a trace.

                        But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
                        
                        Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br>

                        Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”<br>

<img src="images/nevermore.jpg" alt="A silhouette of a raven on top of a power line's pole, with a stormy background.">

<p>
    Throughout the poem's story, the raven gives but one answer to any question presented to it:
    "Nevermore." The bird is communicating with the narrator, telling them that Lenore is gone and
    they'll have to live with those feelings of loss rather than denying reality. Will she return, can I
    be rid of this pain immediately, is she in heaven? "Nevermore." Begone from my chamber and leave
    with no hint of your visit! "Nevermore."<br>

                    <img src="images/ruins.jpg" alt="A photo of stony ruins, with a stormy red sunset as the background.">

                    <p>
                        The narrator has thoroughly rejected the idea of acceptance
                        by lashing out at the bird. Nonetheless, the raven remains watching over the narrator as a
                        persistent presence while the narrator still refuses "acceptance." The final act of rejection is
                        shown at the end of the poem: "And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor,
                        shall be lifted - nevermore!"<br>
